This may take some research but this should be able to interact with our windows systems to perform different tasks
Some of these tasks will be provided by dependencies and others we will need to implement ourselves

Review tacticalrmm for things such as
-remote shells
-remote file browser
-remote command and script execution (Powershell focus)


Examples of our own implementation may be:
-Scanning files in folders to find specific text
